# cmake format

Can format your cmake files nicely so that they don't look like crap.

## Usage

~~~.txt
usage: cmake_format.py [-h] [-i] [-o OUTFILE_PATH] [-c CONFIG_FILE]
                       infilepaths [infilepaths ...]

Parse cmake listfiles and format them nicely.

positional arguments:
  infilepaths

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -i, --in-place
  -o OUTFILE_PATH, --outfile-path OUTFILE_PATH
                        Where to write the formatted file. Default is stdout.
  -c CONFIG_FILE, --config-file CONFIG_FILE
                        path to yaml config
~~~

## Configuration

`cmake_format` accepts configuration files in yaml format. An example
configuration file is given here. Additional flags and additional kwargs will
help `cmake_format` to break up your custom commands in a pleasant way.

~~~.yaml
# How wide to allow formatted cmake files
line_width: 80

# How many spaces to tab for indent
tab_size: 2

# If arglists are longer than this, break them always.
max_subargs_per_line: 3

# Additional FLAGS and KWARGS for custom commands
additional_flags:
  foo: [BAR, BAZ]

additional_kwargs:
  foo: [HEADERS, SOURCES, DEPENDS]
~~~

## Example
Will turn this:
~~~.cmake
# The following multiple newlines should be collapsed into a single newline




cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.8.11)
project(cmake_format_test)

# This multiline-comment should be reflowed
# into a single comment
# on one line

# This comment should remain right before the command call. 
# Furthermore, the command call should be formatted 
# to a single line.
add_subdirectories(foo bar baz
  foo2 bar2 baz2)

# This very long command should be split to multiple lines
set(HEADERS very_long_header_name_a.h very_long_header_name_b.h very_long_header_name_c.h)

# This command should be split into one line per entry because it has a long 
# argument list.
set(SOURCES source_a.cc source_b.cc source_d.cc source_e.cc source_f.cc source_g.cc)

# The string in this command should not be split
set_target_properties(foo bar baz PROPERTIES COMPILE_FLAGS "-std=c++11 -Wall -Wextra")

# This command has a very long argument and can't be aligned with the command
# end, so it should be moved to a new line with block indent + 1.
some_long_command_name("Some very long argument that really needs to be on the next line.")

# This situation is similar but the argument to a KWARG needs to be on a 
# newline instead.
set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "-std=c++11 -Wall -Wno-sign-compare -Wno-unused-parameter -xx")

set(HEADERS header_a.h header_b.h # This comment should 
                                  # be preserved, moreover it should be split 
                                  # across two lines.
    header_c.h header_d.h)

# be formatted
